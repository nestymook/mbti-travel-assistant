## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth Strategy

The implementation follows a defense in depth strategy with multiple security layers:

1. **Input Validation Layer**: Request payload validation and sanitization
2. **Authentication Layer**: JWT token validation and user context extraction
3. **Authorization Layer**: User permissions and access control
4. **Monitoring Layer**: Real-time security event monitoring and correlation
5. **Response Layer**: Automated threat response and incident management

### Security Event Flow

graph TB
    subgraph "Request Processing"
        REQ[HTTP Request]
        AUTH[JWT Authentication]
        VAL[Request Validation]
        PROC[Request Processing]
    end
    
    subgraph "Security Monitoring"
        MON[Security Monitor]
        CORR[Event Correlator]
        AUDIT[Audit Logger]
    end
    
    subgraph "Threat Response"
        ALERT[Security Alerts]
        BLOCK[IP Blocking]
        INCIDENT[Incident Creation]
    end
    
    REQ --> AUTH
    AUTH --> VAL
    VAL --> PROC
    
    AUTH --> MON
    VAL --> MON
    PROC --> MON
    
    MON --> CORR
    MON --> AUDIT
    
    CORR --> ALERT
    MON --> BLOCK
    CORR --> INCIDENT
```

### Risk Assessment Framework

The system implements a comprehensive risk assessment framework:

**User Risk Scoring**:
- Failed authentication attempts ratio
- Suspicious activity frequency
- Multiple IP address usage
- Recent activity patterns
- Historical behavior analysis

**Request Risk Assessment**:
- Payload content analysis
- Source IP reputation
- User agent classification
- Request pattern analysis
- Validation violation severity

**Automated Response Triggers**:
- Critical security violations → Immediate IP blocking
- High-frequency failures → Progressive rate limiting
- Suspicious patterns → Enhanced monitoring
- Threat pattern detection → Security incident creation

## Configuration and Customization

### Validation Rules Configuration

The request validator supports configurable validation rules:

```python
# Custom validation rules
validation_rules = {
    'payload_size_limit': {
        'max_size': 1024 * 1024,  # 1MB
        'severity': 'ERROR'
    },
    'string_length_limit': {
        'max_length': 10000,
        'severity': 'WARNING'
    },
    'malicious_pattern_detection': {
        'enabled': True,
        'severity': 'CRITICAL'
    }
}
```

### Security Monitoring Configuration

The security monitor supports extensive configuration:

```python
# Security monitoring configuration
security_config = {
    'max_failed_attempts': 5,
    'lockout_duration': 300,  # 5 minutes
    'monitoring_window_hours': 24,
    'enable_real_time_monitoring': True,
    'enable_automated_response': True,
    'enable_threat_correlation': True
}
```

### Threat Detection Patterns

Security patterns can be customized for specific environments:

```python
# Custom threat detection patterns
custom_patterns = {
    'user_agents': [
        r'custom_bot_pattern',
        r'internal_scanner'
    ],
    'paths': [
        r'/internal/admin',
        r'/custom/config'
    ],
    'parameters': [
        r'custom_injection_pattern'
    ]
}
```

security_monitor = get_security_monitor()
request_validator = get_request_validator()

# Monitor authentication attempt
security_monitor.monitor_authentication_attempt(
    success=True,
    user_context=user_context,
    request_context=request_context
)

# Validate request payload
validation_result = request_validator.validate_mbti_request(
    payload=request_payload,
    user_context=user_context,
    request_context=request_context

# Get security alerts
alerts = security_monitor.get_security_alerts(
    severity_filter=ErrorSeverity.HIGH,
    status_filter="open"
)

for alert in alerts:
    print(f"Alert: {alert.title}")
    print(f"Severity: {alert.severity}")
    print(f"Actions: {alert.recommended_actions}")
```

### Sensitive Data Sanitization

```python
# Sanitize sensitive data for logging
sensitive_data = {
    'username': 'user123',
    'password': 'secret',
    'api_key': 'sk-12345',
    'normal_field': 'safe_value'
}

sanitized = request_validator.sanitize_sensitive_data(sensitive_data)
# Result: {'username': 'user123', 'password': '***REDACTED***', 
#          'api_key': '***REDACTED***', 'normal_field': 'safe_value'}
