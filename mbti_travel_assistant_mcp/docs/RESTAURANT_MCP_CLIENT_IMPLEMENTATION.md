# Restaurant MCP Client Integration Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Task 6: "Implement restaurant MCP client integration" for the MBTI Travel Assistant. The implementation provides comprehensive restaurant search, assignment, and recommendation functionality using MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers.

## Implementation Summary

### Task 6.1: Create restaurant MCP client manager ✅ COMPLETE

**Requirements Implemented:**
- ✅ RestaurantMCPClient class for meal assignments
- ✅ Breakfast restaurant search (06:00-11:29) with district filtering
- ✅ Lunch restaurant search (11:30-17:29) with district matching

**Key Methods Implemented:**

#### `search_breakfast_restaurants(district, used_restaurant_ids=None)`
- Searches for breakfast restaurants operating 06:00-11:29 in specified district
- Filters out already used restaurants for uniqueness enforcement
- Returns list of available breakfast restaurants

#### `search_lunch_restaurants(districts, used_restaurant_ids=None)`
- Searches for lunch restaurants operating 11:30-17:29 across multiple districts
- Handles morning and afternoon tourist spot districts
- Removes duplicates and enforces uniqueness

#### `search_dinner_restaurants(districts, used_restaurant_ids=None)`
- Searches for dinner restaurants operating 17:30-23:59 across multiple districts
- Handles afternoon and night tourist spot districts
- Implements comprehensive error handling for failed district searches

### Task 6.2: Implement dinner assignment and recommendations ✅ COMPLETE

**Requirements Implemented:**
- ✅ Dinner restaurant search (17:30-23:59) with district matching
- ✅ Restaurant recommendation calls using reasoning MCP
- ✅ Restaurant uniqueness enforcement across all meals

**Key Methods Implemented:**

#### `get_restaurant_recommendations(restaurants, ranking_method="sentiment_likes")`
- Calls restaurant-reasoning-mcp server for intelligent recommendations
- Supports multiple ranking methods (sentiment_likes, combined_sentiment)
- Returns structured recommendation data with candidates

#### `assign_meal_restaurants(morning_district, afternoon_district=None, night_district=None, used_restaurant_ids=None)`
- Assigns restaurants for all three meals of a day
- Implements district matching priority (breakfast→morning, lunch→morning/afternoon, dinner→afternoon/night)
- Enforces restaurant uniqueness across all meals

#### `assign_3day_itinerary_restaurants(day_districts)`
- Assigns restaurants for complete 3-day itinerary
- Maintains uniqueness across entire 9-meal period (3 days × 3 meals)
- Returns structured itinerary with all restaurant assignments

### Task 6.3: Add MCP error handling and retry logic ✅ COMPLETE

**Requirements Implemented:**
- ✅ MCP connection failure handling
- ✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff
- ✅ Fallback restaurant assignment strategies

**Key Methods Implemented:**

#### `search_restaurants_with_fallback(primary_district, meal_type, fallback_districts=None, used_restaurant_ids=None)`
- Implements comprehensive fallback strategy for restaurant searches
- Tries primary district first, then fallback districts
- Falls back to district-agnostic search as last resort

#### `assign_meal_with_fallback(meal_type, primary_district, fallback_districts=None, used_restaurant_ids=None)`
- Assigns restaurants with multiple fallback strategies
- Handles MCP server failures gracefully
- Returns best available restaurant or None if all strategies fail

#### `create_restaurant_assignment_placeholder(meal_type, district, error_message)`
- Creates placeholder assignments when MCP servers are unavailable
- Provides structured error information for debugging
- Includes suggested actions for recovery

#### `assign_meal_restaurants_with_comprehensive_fallback(morning_district, afternoon_district=None, night_district=None, used_restaurant_ids=None, adjacent_districts=None)`
- Most comprehensive assignment method with full error handling
- Uses adjacent district mapping for intelligent fallbacks
- Creates placeholders for failed assignments
- Returns detailed error information and fallback usage

## Additional Functionality

### Candidate Generation

#### `get_restaurant_candidates(meal_type, districts, used_restaurant_ids=None, limit=10)`
- Generates candidate restaurant lists for frontend display
- Filters by meal type and districts
- Excludes already used restaurants
- Returns ranked candidates using reasoning MCP

#### `generate_restaurant_candidates_for_itinerary(day_districts, used_restaurant_ids=None, candidates_per_meal=5)`
- Generates candidates for complete 3-day itinerary
- Organizes candidates by day and meal type
- Maintains uniqueness across entire itinerary

### Validation and Utilities

#### `validate_restaurant_operating_hours(restaurant, meal_type)`
- Validates restaurant operating hours match expected meal times
- Handles missing operating hours (assumes always open)
- Supports all meal types (breakfast, lunch, dinner)

#### `_time_ranges_overlap(range1, range2)` and `_parse_time_range(time_range)`
- Helper methods for time range validation
- Parses time strings into comparable formats
- Detects overlapping operating hours

## Error Handling Architecture

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Prevents cascade failures when MCP servers are down
- Automatically opens circuit after consecutive failures
- Implements half-open state for recovery testing

### Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff
- Retries failed MCP calls with increasing delays
- Adds jitter to prevent thundering herd problems
- Classifies errors as retryable or non-retryable

### Connection Pooling
- Maintains pools of reusable MCP connections
- Implements connection health checking
- Automatic cleanup of expired connections

### Comprehensive Error Classification
- `MCPConnectionError`: Network and connection issues
- `MCPToolCallError`: MCP tool execution failures
- `MCPCircuitBreakerOpenError`: Circuit breaker protection
- `MCPErrorType` enum: Detailed error categorization

## Integration Points

### MCP Server Integration
- **restaurant-search-mcp**: Provides restaurant search functionality
- **restaurant-reasoning-mcp**: Provides intelligent recommendations and ranking

### Data Models Integration
- Uses `Restaurant`, `Sentiment`, `OperatingHours` models
- Converts between dictionary and object formats
- Maintains data integrity throughout processing

### Performance Monitoring
- Tracks MCP call performance and success rates
- Records detailed statistics for monitoring
- Provides health check endpoints

## Usage Examples

### Basic Restaurant Assignment
```python
# Assign restaurants for a single day
assignments = await mcp_client.assign_meal_restaurants(
    morning_district="Central district",
    afternoon_district="Admiralty", 
    night_district="Causeway Bay"
)
```

### 3-Day Itinerary Assignment
```python
# Assign restaurants for complete 3-day itinerary
day_districts = [
    {"morning": "Central district", "afternoon": "Admiralty", "night": "Causeway Bay"},
    {"morning": "Tsim Sha Tsui", "afternoon": "Mong Kok", "night": "Yau Ma Tei"},
    {"morning": "Wan Chai", "afternoon": "Central district", "night": "Admiralty"}
]

itinerary = await mcp_client.assign_3day_itinerary_restaurants(day_districts)
```

### Fallback Assignment with Error Handling
```python
# Comprehensive assignment with fallback strategies
assignments = await mcp_client.assign_meal_restaurants_with_comprehensive_fallback(
    morning_district="Central district",
    afternoon_district="Admiralty",
    night_district="Causeway Bay",
    adjacent_districts={
        "Central district": ["Admiralty", "Wan Chai"],
        "Admiralty": ["Central district", "Wan Chai"]
    }
)
```

## Testing and Validation
