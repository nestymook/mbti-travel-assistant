## Test Execution

### Running All Tests

```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
python tests/run_comprehensive_tests.py

# Run only unit tests with coverage
python tests/run_comprehensive_tests.py --unit-only

# Run only integration tests
python tests/run_comprehensive_tests.py --integration-only

# Run only performance tests
python tests/run_comprehensive_tests.py --performance-only

# Skip performance tests (for CI/CD)
python tests/run_comprehensive_tests.py --skip-performance
```

### Individual Test Suites

```bash
# Unit tests with coverage
pytest tests/test_mcp_client_manager.py --cov=services.mcp_client_manager --cov-report=term-missing

# Integration tests
pytest tests/test_entrypoint_integration.py -v

# Performance tests
pytest tests/test_performance_load.py -v -s
```

### Coverage Reports

```bash
# Generate HTML coverage report
pytest --cov=services --cov=models --cov=main --cov-report=html:tests/results/coverage_html

# Generate JSON coverage report
pytest --cov=services --cov=models --cov=main --cov-report=json:tests/results/coverage.json
```

## Test Results and Reporting

### Automated Reporting

The test runner generates comprehensive reports:

- **`tests/results/comprehensive_test_results.json`** - Detailed JSON results
- **`tests/results/test_summary_report.md`** - Human-readable summary
- **`tests/results/unit_coverage.json`** - Unit test coverage data
- **`tests/results/unit_coverage_html/`** - HTML coverage report

### Coverage Metrics

Target coverage metrics:
- **Overall Coverage**: ≥90%
- **Services Coverage**: ≥90%
- **Models Coverage**: ≥85%
- **Main Entrypoint**: ≥90%

### Performance Benchmarks

Performance requirements validation:
- **Response Time**: <5000ms for standard queries
- **Concurrent Requests**: Handle 10+ concurrent requests
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB increase under sustained load
- **Cache Performance**: >5x speedup for cached responses

## Test Data and Mocking

### Mock Data Strategy

- **Restaurant Data**: Comprehensive sample datasets with varied sentiment scores
- **JWT Tokens**: Valid and invalid tokens for authentication testing
- **MCP Responses**: Realistic search and reasoning responses
- **Error Scenarios**: Various failure modes and edge cases

### External Dependencies

- **MCP Servers**: Mocked using custom MockMCPSession and MockMCPClient classes
- **Cognito**: Mocked using moto library for AWS service simulation
- **Strands Agents**: Mocked for unit testing, real integration for end-to-end tests
- **Network Calls**: Mocked using responses and aioresponses libraries

## Continuous Integration

### CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run Tests
  run: |
    pip install -r tests/requirements-test.txt
    python tests/run_comprehensive_tests.py --skip-performance
    
- name: Upload Coverage
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    file: tests/results/unit_coverage.json
```

### Quality Gates

- All tests must pass
- Coverage must be ≥90%
- No critical security vulnerabilities
- Performance benchmarks must be met

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MCP Server Connection Failures**: Tests use mocks by default, real MCP servers only needed for optional integration tests
2. **Authentication Errors**: Cognito services are mocked, no real AWS credentials needed
3. **Performance Test Failures**: May need adjustment for different hardware configurations
4. **Coverage Below 90%**: Add more unit tests for uncovered code paths

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Run tests with debug output
pytest tests/ -v -s --log-cli-level=DEBUG

# Run specific test with debugging
pytest tests/test_mcp_client_manager.py::TestMCPClientManager::test_search_restaurants_success -v -s
```

## Maintenance

### Adding New Tests

1. Follow existing naming conventions (`test_*.py`)
2. Use appropriate fixtures and mocks
3. Include both success and failure scenarios
4. Add performance tests for new critical paths
5. Update this documentation

### Coverage Monitoring

- Monitor coverage reports after each change
- Add tests for any new code that drops coverage below 90%
- Review uncovered lines in HTML coverage reports
- Focus on critical error handling paths
