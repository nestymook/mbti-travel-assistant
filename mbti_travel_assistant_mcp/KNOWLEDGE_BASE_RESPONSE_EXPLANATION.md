# Knowledge Base Response Analysis & Explanation

**Date:** September 29, 2025  
**Knowledge Base ID:** 1FJ1VHU5OW  
**Analysis:** Understanding what the knowledge base returns and why

## 🤔 **YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED**

### **Q1: What are the returned prompts from the knowledge base?**

**Answer:** The knowledge base doesn't return "prompts" - it returns **document chunks** with their content. Here's what you actually get:

#### **📄 Document Structure Returned:**
```json
{
  "content": {
    "text": "# M+\r\n\r\n## MBTI Personality Match\r\n**Type:** INFJ...",
    "type": "TEXT"
  },
  "location": {
    "s3Location": {
      "uri": "s3://mbti-knowledgebase-209803798463-us-east-1/kowloon/tsim_sha_tsui/INFJ_M+.md"
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "x-amz-bedrock-kb-source-uri": "s3://...",
    "x-amz-bedrock-kb-chunk-id": "1%3A0%3A...",
    "x-amz-bedrock-kb-data-source-id": "HBOBHF8WHN"
  },
  "score": 0.5494437
}
```

#### **🔍 What Each Part Means:**
- **`content.text`**: The actual document content (attraction information)
- **`location.s3Location.uri`**: Where the original file is stored in S3
- **`metadata`**: Technical information about the document chunk
- **`score`**: Relevance score (0.0 to 1.0) showing how well it matches your query

### **Q2: Why do we always get exactly 100 documents?**

**Answer:** Because that's what we **requested**! Here's the proof:

#### **🧪 Test Results with Different Limits:**
```
Requested:   5 → Got:   5 results
Requested:  10 → Got:  10 results  
Requested:  20 → Got:  20 results
Requested:  50 → Got:  50 results
Requested: 100 → Got: 100 results
```

#### **⚙️ How It Works:**
1. **You specify** `numberOfResults: 100` in the retrieval configuration
2. **Bedrock finds** the top 100 most relevant documents using vector similarity
3. **Bedrock returns** exactly 100 results (or fewer if less than 100 exist)
4. **The knowledge base has 183 total documents**, so it can always fulfill requests up to 183

#### **🎯 Key Point:**
- If you request 100, you get 100 (assuming enough documents exist)
- If you request 200, you'd get 183 (the maximum available)
- If you request 5, you get 5

### **Q3: What do "INFJ Matches" mean?**

**Answer:** INFJ Matches are documents **specifically created for INFJ personality types**.

#### **📊 INFJ Match Analysis:**
- **Total Documents Returned:** 100
- **INFJ Matches:** 12 documents (12%)
- **Other MBTI Types:** 88 documents (88%)

#### **🎯 What This Means:**
1. **INFJ Matches (12 documents):** Attractions specifically recommended for INFJ personalities
   - Example: "M+ Museum - **Type:** INFJ - Visionary art for reflection"
   
2. **Other Matches (88 documents):** Attractions for other MBTI types that are still relevant
   - Example: "Hong Kong Disneyland - **Type:** ESFJ - Fun theme park"
   - These appear because they're semantically similar to your query

#### **🔍 Why Do We Get Non-INFJ Results?**
The vector search finds documents based on **semantic similarity**, not exact keyword matching:

- **Query:** "INFJ personality type attractions"
- **Vector embedding** captures concepts like: personality, attractions, recommendations, Hong Kong
- **Similar documents** include other MBTI types because they share similar concepts
- **Ranking by relevance** puts INFJ documents at the top (higher scores)

## 🔍 **HOW THE KNOWLEDGE BASE WORKS**

### **1. Vector Embedding Process:**
```
Your Query → Vector Embedding → Similarity Search → Ranked Results
```

### **2. Document Processing:**
- **183 total documents** in the knowledge base
- **Each document** represents one MBTI type + one attraction
- **No chunking** strategy means each document is processed as a complete unit
- **Amazon Nova Pro** parsed the original markdown files
- **Titan Embeddings** created vector representations

### **3. Search Process:**
1. **Your query** gets converted to a vector embedding
2. **Vector similarity** is calculated against all 183 documents
3. **Top N results** are returned based on similarity scores
4. **Results include** both exact matches (INFJ) and similar content (other MBTI types)

---

## 🎯 **PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS**

### **✅ What This Means for Your Application:**

1. **Flexible Search:** Users get relevant results even if exact matches are limited
2. **Comprehensive Coverage:** All areas and districts are represented
3. **Personality Matching:** INFJ-specific attractions are prioritized (higher scores)
4. **Fallback Options:** Other personality types provide alternative suggestions

### **🔧 How to Optimize Results:**

#### **For More INFJ-Specific Results:**
```python
# More specific query
query = "INFJ personality type museums galleries quiet contemplative spaces"
```

#### **For Geographic Filtering:**
```python
# Location-specific query  
query = "INFJ Central District Hong Kong Island attractions"
```

#### **For Activity-Based Search:**
```python
# Activity-specific query
query = "INFJ art galleries museums cultural centers Hong Kong"
```

## 📋 **SUMMARY**

### **🎯 Key Takeaways:**

1. **"100 documents found"** = You requested 100, so you got 100
2. **"INFJ Matches"** = Documents specifically for INFJ personality type
3. **"Other results"** = Semantically similar attractions for other MBTI types
4. **"Scores"** = Relevance ranking from vector similarity search
5. **"Geographic spread"** = Results cover multiple areas/districts in Hong Kong

### **✅ The System is Working Correctly:**
- ✅ Returns requested number of results
