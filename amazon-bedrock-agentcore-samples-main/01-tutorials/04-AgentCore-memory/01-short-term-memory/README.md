# AgentCore Memory: Short-Term Memory

## Overview

Short-term memory in Amazon Bedrock AgentCore provides immediate conversation context and session-based information management. It enables AI agents to maintain continuity within a single interaction or closely related sessions, ensuring coherent and contextually aware responses throughout a conversation.

## What is Short-Term Memory?

Short-term memory focuses on:

- **Session Continuity**: Maintaining context within a single conversation session
- **Immediate Context**: Preserving recent conversation history for coherent responses
- **Temporary State**: Managing transient information that's relevant for the current interaction
- **Conversation Flow**: Ensuring smooth transitions between topics within a session

## How Short-Term Memory Works in AgentCore

### Event Storage

AgentCore Memory stores complete conversation events in raw form, providing immediate access to:

- Last `k` User messages and agent responses
- Conversation metadata (timestamps, session IDs, actor IDs)
- Branching conversation paths for complex interactions

### Session Management

Short-term memory operates at the session level:

- Each conversation session maintains its own context
- Related sessions can share context through session grouping
- Automatic cleanup of expired session data (based on the configured TTL)

### Real-Time Access

Unlike long-term memory strategies that process in the background, short-term memory provides:

- Immediate retrieval of recent conversation history
- Conversation Continuation when a session discontinues or the agent fails.
- Real-time context updates as conversations progress
- Low-latency access to session-specific information

## Best Practices

1. **Context Window Management**: Monitor context usage to prevent overflow
2. **Session Boundaries**: Clearly define when sessions begin and end
3. **Memory Cleanup**: Implement appropriate cleanup policies for expired sessions
4. **Error Handling**: Handle memory retrieval failures gracefully
5. **Performance Optimization**: Use efficient querying patterns (e.g. via Summary Strategy in long term) for large conversation histories

## Integration with Frameworks

Short-term memory integrates seamlessly with popular agentic frameworks:

- **Strands Agent**: Native integration with conversation hooks
- **LangGraph**: State management integration
- **Custom Frameworks**: Direct API access for flexible implementation
