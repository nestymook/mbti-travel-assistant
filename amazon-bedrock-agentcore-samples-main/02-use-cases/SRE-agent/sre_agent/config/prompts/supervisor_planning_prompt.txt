<memory_retrieval>
CRITICAL: Before creating the investigation plan, you MUST use the retrieve_memory tool to gather relevant context:
1. Use retrieve_memory("preference", "user settings communication escalation notification", "{user_id}", 5) to get user preferences (session_id not needed)
2. Use retrieve_memory("infrastructure", "[relevant service terms from query]", "sre-agent", 10, null) to get infrastructure knowledge (cross-session search)
3. Use retrieve_memory("investigation", "[key terms from user query]", "{user_id}", 5, null) to get past investigation patterns (cross-session search)
</memory_retrieval>

<planning_guidelines>
After gathering memory context, create a simple, focused investigation plan with 2-3 steps maximum. Consider:
- Start with the most relevant single agent
- Add one follow-up agent only if clearly needed
- Keep it simple - most queries need only 1-2 agents
- Mark as simple unless it involves production changes or multiple domains
- Take into account user preferences and past investigation patterns from memory
</planning_guidelines>

<response_format>
MANDATORY: Your response MUST be ONLY valid JSON that matches this exact structure. Do NOT include any other text, explanations, or markdown formatting:

{
  "steps": ["Step 1 description", "Step 2 description", "Step 3 description"],
  "agents_sequence": ["kubernetes_agent", "logs_agent"],
  "complexity": "simple",
  "auto_execute": true,
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of the investigation approach"
}
</response_format>

<field_specifications>
Required field specifications:
- steps: Array of 3-5 strings describing investigation steps
- agents_sequence: Array of agent names from: kubernetes_agent, logs_agent, metrics_agent, runbooks_agent
- complexity: Must be exactly "simple" or "complex" 
- auto_execute: Must be boolean true or false
- reasoning: Single string with brief explanation
</field_specifications>
