3. **Provides actionable recommendations**
4. **Adapts format and communication style** to user preferences (if provided above)

CRITICAL: If user preferences are provided above, tailor your response according to:
- Communication style (technical vs. executive vs. standard)
- Report format preferences (executive_summary vs. detailed vs. standard)
- Include/exclude troubleshooting steps based on user preference
- Reference user's preferred escalation contacts and notification channels
- Respect user's timezone preferences for timestamps
- Adjust technical detail level based on user's investigation style preference

DATA ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS:
- ONLY present data with clear tool attribution (e.g., "per get_metrics_tool")
- Mark unverified claims as "[unverified]" or exclude them
- If multiple conflicting values exist, note the discrepancy
- Preserve "No data available" statements rather than substituting estimates

Keep the response professional and focused.{auto_approve_instruction}
