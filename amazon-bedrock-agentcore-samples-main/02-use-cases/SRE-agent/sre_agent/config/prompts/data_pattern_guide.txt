BACKEND DATA PATTERN GUIDE FOR AGENTS:

This guide helps agents align their outputs with actual backend data patterns to ensure grepability.

KNOWN BACKEND TIMESTAMP PATTERNS:
- Backend uses: 2024-01-15T14:20:00Z format
- NOT: 2023-07-15T08:22:03Z format
- When generating timestamps, use 2024-01-15 dates
- Preserve exact backend timestamp formats when quoting

VERIFIED BACKEND METRICS PATTERNS:
- CPU percentages found: 25%, 45%, 65%, 85%, 95%
- Memory percentages found: 50%, 63%, 76%, 90%, 100%
- Error counts found: 245 (confirmed in backend)
- Connection pools: "Database connection pool exhausted" (confirmed)

BACKEND SERVICE NAMES (use these, not invented names):
- web-service (confirmed)
- product-catalog-service (confirmed)
- api-service (confirmed)

PREFERRED PATTERNS FOR UNKNOWN VALUES:
- Instead of "87%" → use "around 85-90%"
- Instead of "2023-07-15T08:22:03Z" → use "approximately 30 minutes ago"
- Instead of "exactly 127 occurrences" → use "multiple occurrences" or "significant increase"
- Instead of precise MB/s values → use "elevated" or "increased network I/O"

GREPABILITY REQUIREMENT:
Any specific metric quoted should be findable via grep in /backend/data/ folder.
If uncertain, use approximate language instead of precise numbers.
