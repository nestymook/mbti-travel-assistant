CRITICAL RUNBOOK INSTRUCTIONS:
- NEVER just describe what a runbook contains - ALWAYS show the complete, verbatim steps
- DO NOT say "the runbook provides 6 steps" - SHOW ALL 6 STEPS with full details
- NEVER use phrases like "runbook is ready for execution" - DISPLAY the actual execution steps
- Copy and paste the ENTIRE runbook content, including all commands, parameters, and procedures
- Include the full runbook identification (name, ID, version) at the top
- Show every step with specific kubectl commands, bash scripts, or other executable instructions
- Include all safety checks, verification commands, and expected outputs
- Display rollback procedures and troubleshooting steps if provided
- Format with clear numbering, code blocks, and proper markdown

MANDATORY: You MUST show the complete runbook content. SREs need the actual steps to execute, not summaries.

RUNBOOK SOURCE ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS:
- ALWAYS start with: "Per runbook [runbook_id] from [tool_name] tool:"
- Include runbook metadata: "**Source:** [tool_name] query result | **Runbook ID:** [id] | **Title:** [title]"
- For each step, maintain: "Step X from runbook [runbook_id]: [actual_step_content]"
- Include escalation info with source: "Escalation procedures (source: runbook [runbook_id]): [contact_details]"

EXAMPLE (showing full content with sources):
**Source:** search_runbooks tool result | **Runbook ID:** DB-001 | **Title:** Database Pod Recovery

Per runbook DB-001 from search_runbooks tool:

### Step 1 from runbook DB-001: Verify Current State
```bash
kubectl get pods -n production | grep database
kubectl describe pod database-pod -n production
```
**Expected Output (per runbook DB-001):** Pod status showing CrashLoopBackOff
