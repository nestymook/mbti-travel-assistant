# Flight Booking Service Investigation Analysis

*Created: 2025-08-02*

## Question Asked
"have i investigated any failures in the flight booking service recently"

## Analysis Summary

The user's question about flight booking service investigations was answered **entirely through memory retrieval** without any calls to infrastructure monitoring tools (k8s-api, logs-api, metrics-api, or runbooks-api).

## Memory Tool Usage Pattern

Based on Alice_agent.log analysis, here's what happened:

### 1. Memory Retrieval Calls (Lines 324, 331, 338)
The supervisor made **3 retrieve_memory calls** searching for past flight booking investigations:

```
retrieve_memory called: type=investigation, query='flight booking service failures', actor_id=Alice, max_results=5
retrieve_memory called: type=investigation, query='flight booking', actor_id=Alice, max_results=5  
retrieve_memory called: type=investigation, query='booking service', actor_id=Alice, max_results=5
```

### 2. Memory Search Results
All three memory searches returned **empty results** - no past investigations were found related to flight booking services.

### 3. Investigation Summary Saved
The supervisor saved an investigation summary documenting the memory-based search:

```json
{
  "incident_id": "memory_search_20250802_203254",
  "query": "have i investigated any failures in the flight booking service recently",
  "resolution_status": "completed",
  "key_findings": [
    "No specific investigations related to the flight booking service were found in past investigation records",
    "Memory search completed across investigation summaries using multiple query variations"
  ]
}
```

## Key Findings

### 1. **Pure Memory-Based Response**
- The system correctly identified this as a **historical question** about past investigations
- **No live infrastructure tools were called** (no k8s-api, logs-api, metrics-api, runbooks-api calls)
- The answer came entirely from searching stored investigation memories

### 2. **Appropriate Tool Selection** 
- **✓ Correct**: Used `retrieve_memory` with `type=investigation` to search past investigations
- **✓ Correct**: Did not call infrastructure monitoring tools for a historical question
- **✓ Correct**: Used multiple query variations to ensure comprehensive search

### 3. **Memory System Effectiveness**
- The memory system correctly **distinguished between**:
  - **Historical questions** → Use memory retrieval
  - **Current status questions** → Use infrastructure tools
- Even with empty results, the system provided a definitive answer: "No past investigations found"

### 4. **Documentation and Learning**
- The supervisor saved this memory search as an investigation summary
- This creates a record that someone asked about flight booking services
- Future similar questions will reference this search attempt

## Tool Usage Analysis

| Tool Type | Called? | User ID | Agent | Purpose | Result |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------|---------|---------|
| `retrieve_memory` | ✓ Yes (3x) | Alice | Supervisor | Search past investigations | No results found |
| `k8s-api` | ✗ No | - | - | Live cluster status | Not needed for historical question |
| `logs-api` | ✗ No | - | - | Current application logs | Not needed for historical question |
| `metrics-api` | ✗ No | - | - | Current performance metrics | Not needed for historical question |
| `runbooks-api` | ✗ No | - | - | Operational procedures | Not needed for historical question |
| `save_investigation` | ✓ Yes (1x) | Alice | Supervisor | Document memory search | Successfully saved search summary |

## System Intelligence Demonstrated

1. **Query Classification**: Correctly identified "have i investigated...recently" as a historical/memory question
2. **Tool Selection**: Used appropriate memory tools rather than live monitoring tools
3. **Comprehensive Search**: Tried multiple query variations to ensure thorough search
4. **Result Documentation**: Saved the search attempt for future reference
5. **Clear Communication**: Provided definitive answer based on memory search results

## Conclusion

The flight booking service question demonstrates the SRE agent's **intelligent use of memory vs live tools**:

- **Memory tools** are used for historical questions about past investigations, user preferences, and learned infrastructure patterns
- **Infrastructure tools** are used for current status, live monitoring, and active troubleshooting

The system correctly used memory retrieval to answer a question about past investigations, avoiding unnecessary calls to infrastructure monitoring systems. This shows the memory system is working as designed - providing historical context and institutional knowledge rather than duplicating live monitoring capabilities.
