# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** API response times have degraded 3x in the last hour

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database configuration failure causing connection timeouts - missing ConfigMap 'database-config' and invalid permissions on data directory
- **Impact**: Performance degradation with 33x response time increase (150ms to 5000ms) in web-service
- **Severity**: High - Memory exhaustion (100% utilization), high CPU (95%), and 75% error rate causing significant service instability

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Create/restore missing 'database-config' ConfigMap in production namespace and fix permissions on database data directory
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Increase Java heap space allocation for web-service and implement connection pooling with proper timeout handling
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Optimize slow query "SELECT * FROM users WHERE status='active'" and implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
4. **Follow-up**: Set up alerts for database connection timeouts and memory usage in #alice-alerts and #sre-team channels

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) failing with "Permission denied on data directory" errors
- Web-service experiencing OutOfMemoryError causing application shutdowns
- Error rate increased from 0.5% to 75% with server errors (500, 503) increasing from 5 to 148

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Performance Metrics Agent
- ## API Response Time Degradation Analysis

Based on the metrics data, I can confirm a severe API response time degradation in the `web-service` over the past hour. Here's what the data shows:

### Response Time Degradation
According to get_performance_metrics data:
- Initial response time (14:20:00Z): 150ms
- Current response time (14:24:00Z): 5000ms
- **This represents a 33x increase in response time** (from 150ms to 5000ms)

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Resource Exhaustion**:
   - CPU usage increased from 25% to 95% (source: get_resource_metrics)
   - Memory usage reached 100% (1024MB) from an initial 50% (512MB) (source: get_resource_metrics)

2. **Error Rate Explosion**:
   - Error rate increased from 0.5% to 75% (source: get_error_rates)
   - Server errors (500, 503) dramatically increased from 5 to 148 (source: get_error_rates)

3. **Database Issues**:
   - Database service shows 100% error rate with "connection_refused" errors (source: get_error_rates)
   - Database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) reporting "Permission denied on data directory" (source: get_error_rates)

4. **Traffic Impact**:
   - Sample count dropped from 100 to 20 (source: get_performance_metrics)
   - Total requests decreased from 1000 to 200 (source: get_error_rates)

### Trend Analysis
According to analyze_trends tool:
- The response time trend is "increasing"
- Average response time: 2500ms
- Two significant anomalies detected at 14:23:00Z and 14:24:00Z with deviation percentages of 40% and 100% respectively

## Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate Database Investigation**:
   - Fix the database permission issue on pod database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q
   - Check database connection configuration in web-service

2. **Resource Scaling**:
   - Increase memory allocation for web-service (currently at 100% utilization)
   - Scale up CPU resources for web-service (currently at 95% utilization)

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
   - Add retry logic for database connections

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Continue monitoring response times after implementing fixes
   - Set up alerts for early detection of similar degradation patterns

The primary issue appears to be database connectivity problems causing resource exhaustion in the web-service as it attempts to handle failed database connections.

Data sources:
- get_performance_metrics: Response time increased from 150ms to 5000ms
- get_resource_metrics: CPU usage increased to 95%, memory usage reached 100%
- get_error_rates: Error rate increased to 75%, database showing connection refused errors
- analyze_trends: Confirmed increasing trend with significant anomalies

### Application Logs Agent
- ## API Response Time Degradation Analysis

Based on the log analysis, I've identified several critical issues causing the API response time degradation:

### Root Causes Identified:

1. **Database Connection Failures**
   According to get_error_logs, the web-service is experiencing database connection timeouts:
   - Error at 14:23:46.567Z: "Database connection timeout after 5000ms"
   - Error at 14:23:47.890Z: "Failed to process request: java.sql.SQLException: Connection timed out"

2. **Database Configuration Issues**
   According to get_error_logs, the database pod is failing to start properly:
   - Error at 14:22:30.123Z: "FATAL: could not open configuration file '/etc/postgresql/database.conf': No such file or directory"
   - Error at 14:23:00.789Z: "FATAL: data directory '/var/lib/postgresql/data' has invalid permissions"
   - Error at 14:23:30.012Z: "ERROR: ConfigMap 'database-config' not found in namespace 'production'"

3. **Memory Exhaustion in Web Service**
   According to get_error_logs, the web-service is experiencing memory issues:
   - Error at 14:24:30.789Z: "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space"
   - Error at 14:25:11.456Z: "Application shutting down due to critical error"

4. **Slow Database Queries**
   According to analyze_log_patterns, there are recurring slow queries:
   - Pattern: "Slow query detected" occurred 25 times between 14:22:15.789Z and 14:23:45.234Z
   - Example: "Slow query detected: SELECT * FROM users WHERE status='active' - Duration: 1250ms"

### Impact Analysis:

1. **Error Distribution**
   According to count_log_events, the errors are distributed across services:
   - web-service: 35 errors (77.8%)
   - api-service: 8 errors (17.8%)
   - database-service: 2 errors (4.4%)

2. **Pattern Analysis**
   According to analyze_log_patterns:
   - "Database connection timeout" pattern: 15 occurrences
   - "OutOfMemoryError" pattern: 8 occurrences
   - "Slow query detected" pattern: 25 occurrences

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Fix the database ConfigMap issue: Create or restore the missing 'database-config' ConfigMap in the production namespace
   - Correct permissions on the database data directory: `/var/lib/postgresql/data` needs proper ownership
   - Restart the database pod after fixing configuration issues

2. **Web Service Remediation:**
   - Increase Java heap space allocation to address OutOfMemoryError
   - Implement connection pooling with proper timeout handling
   - Add circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures during database outages

3. **Database Optimization:**
   - Review and optimize the slow query: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE status='active'"
   - Consider adding appropriate indexes to improve query performance
   - Implement query caching where appropriate

4. **Monitoring Enhancements:**
   - Set up alerts for database connection timeouts
   - Monitor memory usage in the web-service to prevent future OutOfMemoryErrors
   - Implement slow query logging and alerting

The API response time degradation is primarily caused by database connectivity issues and memory exhaustion in the web-service. The database configuration problems are preventing proper database startup, leading to connection timeouts in the web-service, which in turn is causing memory issues as connection attempts accumulate.
