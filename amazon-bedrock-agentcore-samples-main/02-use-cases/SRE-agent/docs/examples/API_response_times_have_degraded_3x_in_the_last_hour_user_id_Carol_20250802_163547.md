# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** API response times have degraded 3x in the last hour

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database service failure due to missing ConfigMap 'database-config' in production namespace, causing cascading failures
- **Impact**: Severe performance degradation with API response times increasing from 150ms to 5000ms (33x slower)
- **Severity**: High - Web-service experiencing memory saturation (100%), 75% error rate, and eventual OutOfMemoryErrors

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Create/restore missing ConfigMap 'database-config' in production namespace and fix database data directory permissions
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Increase web-service memory allocation and implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Increase database connection pool size from current 10 connections and optimize slow queries
4. **Follow-up**: Notify executive team if not resolved within 20 minutes per escalation parameters

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Database service showing 100% error rate with "ConfigMap not found" errors
- Web-service experiencing OutOfMemoryErrors leading to application shutdown at 14:25:11
- API throughput dropped from 1000 to 200 requests with 75% error rate

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Performance Metrics Agent
- ## API Response Time Degradation Analysis

Based on the metrics data, I can confirm a severe API response time degradation in the last hour, with response times increasing by more than 33x (not just 3x) for the web-service API.

### Key Findings:

1. **Response Time Degradation**:
   - According to get_performance_metrics data, the `/api/users` endpoint response time increased from 150ms to 5000ms within 5 minutes (14:20 to 14:24)
   - The p95 response time increased from 200ms to 5000ms
   - Sample count dropped from 100 to 20, indicating reduced throughput

2. **Resource Constraints**:
   - CPU usage: Increased from 25% to 95% (source: get_resource_metrics)
   - Memory usage: Increased from 50% (512MB) to 100% (1024MB) (source: get_resource_metrics)
   - Memory saturation appears to be a critical issue

3. **Error Rate Spike**:
   - Error rate increased from 0.5% to 75% (source: get_error_rates)
   - Server errors (5xx) increased dramatically from 5 to 148
   - Total requests dropped from 1000 to 200, suggesting service degradation

4. **Database Issues**:
   - Database service shows 100% error rate with "ConfigMap not found" and "Permission denied on data directory" errors
   - Connection refused errors consistently present (source: get_error_rates)

5. **Trend Analysis**:
   - Analyze_trends confirms an increasing trend with anomalies detected at 14:23 and 14:24
   - Latest response time (5000ms) shows 100% deviation from normal patterns

### Root Cause:

The primary issue appears to be database connectivity problems causing the web-service to experience memory saturation and increased response times. The database errors ("ConfigMap not found" and "Permission denied") suggest a configuration or permission issue that is preventing proper database operation.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate**:
   - Check database ConfigMap and fix the missing configuration
   - Verify database pod permissions on the data directory
   - Consider scaling up web-service resources temporarily to handle the load

2. **Short-term**:
   - Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
   - Add memory limits to prevent complete saturation
   - Review database connection pooling configuration

3. **Long-term**:
   - Implement better monitoring for database connectivity issues
   - Add graceful degradation for database failures
   - Review error handling in the web-service to better manage database failures

### Application Logs Agent
- # API Response Time Degradation Analysis

Based on the log analysis, I've identified the root causes of the API response time degradation over the last hour.

## Key Findings:

1. **Database Connection Issues**
   - According to get_error_logs, the database service is experiencing critical failures since 14:22:30
   - Multiple database errors found:
     - Missing configuration file: `FATAL: could not open configuration file '/etc/postgresql/database.conf': No such file or directory` (14:22:30)
     - Permission issues: `FATAL: data directory '/var/lib/postgresql/data' has invalid permissions` (14:23:00)
     - Missing ConfigMap: `ERROR: ConfigMap 'database-config' not found in namespace 'production'` (14:23:30)
   - Database container failing liveness probes at 14:24:30

2. **Connection Pool Exhaustion**
   - According to search_logs, the web-service reported "Database connection pool exhausted" at 14:23:45
   - Connection pool was initially configured with only 10 connections (from logs at 14:20:16)

3. **Memory Issues in Web Service**
   - Multiple OutOfMemoryError occurrences detected starting at 14:24:30
   - According to analyze_log_patterns, 8 OutOfMemoryError events occurred between 14:24:30 and 14:25:10
   - Critical failure leading to application shutdown at 14:25:11

4. **Slow Queries**
   - According to analyze_log_patterns, 25 slow query warnings were detected between 14:22:15 and 14:23:45
   - Example: `Slow query detected: SELECT * FROM users WHERE status='active' - Duration: 1250ms`

5. **Error Distribution**
   - According to count_log_events, 77.8% of all errors are coming from the web-service
   - Database connection timeouts started at 14:23:46 and continued through 14:24:30

## Root Cause Analysis:

The API response time degradation appears to be caused by a chain of events:

1. The database service failed due to missing configuration (ConfigMap 'database-config' not found)
2. This led to connection timeouts in the web-service
3. The connection pool became exhausted as requests backed up
4. Slow queries accumulated, further degrading performance
5. Eventually, the web-service experienced memory issues trying to handle the backlog
6. This culminated in OutOfMemoryErrors and application shutdown

## Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate:**
   - Create or restore the missing ConfigMap 'database-config' in the production namespace
   - Fix permissions on the database data directory: `/var/lib/postgresql/data`
   - Restart the database pod: `database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q`
   - Increase memory allocation for the web-service to prevent OutOfMemoryErrors

2. **Short-term:**
   - Increase the database connection pool size from 10 to a more appropriate value
   - Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures when database is unavailable
   - Optimize the slow queries identified in the logs, particularly the `SELECT * FROM users WHERE status='active'` query

3. **Long-term:**
   - Implement better monitoring for database connectivity issues
   - Add graceful degradation for database failures
   - Review memory usage patterns in the web-service, particularly in the UserService.loadAllUsers method
   - Implement connection pooling best practices with appropriate timeouts
