# Security Considerations

## Overview

This document outlines security best practices and considerations for deploying and operating the SRE Multi-Agent System in production environments. Security is critical when handling infrastructure data and operational procedures.

## Security Best Practices

### Authentication and Authorization
- Implement API authentication using OAuth2 or API keys for infrastructure endpoints
- Use AWS IAM roles for Bedrock access instead of long-lived credentials
- Apply principle of least privilege for API access
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types and permissions

### Encryption and Data Protection
- Enable TLS encryption for all API communications
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Use secure secret management systems for credential storage
- Protect personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive infrastructure details

### Operational Security
- Implement comprehensive audit logging for agent actions and investigations
- Regularly rotate API keys and tokens
- Monitor for unusual access patterns or suspicious activities
- Enable logging and monitoring for security events and anomalies

### Input Validation and Prompt Security
- Validate all user inputs to prevent prompt injection attacks
- Implement input sanitization for queries and commands
- Use Amazon Bedrock Guardrails to protect against malicious prompts
- Restrict agent capabilities based on user authorization levels

### Infrastructure Security
- Deploy the system in secure network environments with proper firewall rules
- Use VPC endpoints for AWS service communications when possible
- Implement network segmentation between different system components
- Regularly update dependencies and apply security patches

### Compliance and Governance
- Maintain audit trails for compliance requirements
- Implement data retention policies for logs and investigation records
- Ensure compliance with organizational security policies and standards
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing
