# Cognito Login Investigation & Fix

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Callback URL Mismatch**
The Cognito User Pool Client is configured with:
- Callback URLs: `https://d39ank8zud5pbg.cloudfront.net/` and `https://d39ank8zud5pbg.cloudfront.net/auth/callback`
- But the frontend is expecting the callback at `/auth/callback` route

### 2. **Missing CORS Headers**
CloudFront distribution doesn't have proper CORS headers configured for OAuth flow.

### 3. **Token Exchange Issues**
The OAuth callback processing might be failing due to:
- Incorrect redirect URI in token exchange
- Missing CORS headers
- Timing issues with Amplify initialization

### 4. **Router Configuration**
The router has OAuth callback detection but might not be handling all cases properly.

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issue appears to be that when users are redirected back from Cognito after authentication, the callback URL handling is not working correctly. This could be due to:

1. **CloudFront caching issues** - The SPA routing might not be working correctly
2. **CORS configuration** - Missing headers for OAuth flow
3. **Callback URL configuration** - Mismatch between Cognito and frontend expectations

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Fix Callback URL Configuration
Update Cognito User Pool Client to use the correct callback URL and ensure proper routing.

### Solution 2: Add CORS Headers to CloudFront
Configure proper response headers for OAuth flow.

### Solution 3: Improve OAuth Callback Handling
Enhance the callback processing to handle edge cases.

### Solution 4: Add Debug Capabilities
Implement better debugging to identify the exact failure point.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Update Cognito Configuration** - Fix callback URLs
2. **Configure CloudFront Headers** - Add CORS and security headers
3. **Enhance Callback Processing** - Improve error handling and debugging
4. **Test OAuth Flow** - Verify end-to-end authentication
