# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating an MBTI Travel Assistant that operates as a Bedrock AgentCore runtime service that receives HTTP requests from web servers and uses an internal LLM to orchestrate calls to existing deployed AgentCore MCP servers for restaurant search and sentiment-based reasoning.

The application follows the BedrockAgentCore runtime pattern with an entrypoint that receives structured payloads, processes them through an internal LLM agent, and returns exactly one recommended restaurant plus 19 candidate restaurants in JSON format optimized for front-end web application consumption. The internal LLM acts as an MCP client to communicate with existing deployed AgentCore MCP servers: `restaurant_search_conversational_agent-dsuHTs5FJn` and `restaurant_reasoning_mcp-UFz1VQCFu1`.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1 - HTTP Payload Processing and LLM Orchestration

**User Story:** As a web server, I want to send HTTP requests with district and meal time payloads to the MBTI Travel Assistant, so that I can receive structured restaurant recommendations processed by an internal LLM that coordinates with existing MCP servers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an HTTP request is received with JWT authentication THEN the system SHALL validate the JWT token and extract user context
2. WHEN a payload contains district and meal time parameters THEN the system SHALL pass this information to an internal LLM agent for processing
3. WHEN the internal LLM processes the request THEN it SHALL act as an MCP client to call existing MCP servers (`restaurant_search_conversational_agent` and `restaurant_reasoning_mcp`)
4. WHEN MCP client calls are made THEN the LLM SHALL coordinate the workflow: first search for restaurants, then analyze sentiment and generate recommendations
5. WHEN MCP responses are received THEN the LLM SHALL process the results and format exactly 1 recommended restaurant and 19 candidate restaurants
6. WHEN the final response is generated THEN it SHALL be returned as structured JSON suitable for front-end web application display
7. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 with appropriate error messages
8. IF MCP server calls fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error responses

### Requirement 2 - BedrockAgentCore Runtime Implementation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the MBTI Travel Assistant to be implemented as a BedrockAgentCore runtime with an entrypoint, so that it can receive HTTP payloads and process them through an internal LLM agent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL create a BedrockAgentCoreApp instance with an @app.entrypoint decorator
2. WHEN a payload is received at the entrypoint THEN it SHALL extract district and meal time parameters from the payload structure
3. WHEN the entrypoint processes a request THEN it SHALL pass the parameters to an internal Strands Agent or similar LLM framework
4. WHEN the LLM agent is configured THEN it SHALL have access to MCP client capabilities to call external MCP servers
5. WHEN the LLM processes the request THEN it SHALL automatically determine the sequence of MCP calls needed (search first, then reasoning)
6. WHEN the agent generates a response THEN it SHALL return a JSON-serializable string containing the formatted restaurant recommendations
7. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL use app.run() to start the BedrockAgentCore runtime server
8. IF payload structure is invalid THEN the entrypoint SHALL handle the error gracefully and return appropriate error messages
9. IF the internal LLM agent fails THEN the system SHALL return a fallback response with error details
10. WHEN multiple MCP calls are needed THEN the agent SHALL orchestrate them in the correct sequence to fulfill the request

### Requirement 3 - MCP Client Integration for Internal LLM

2. WHEN making calls to the search server THEN the LLM SHALL use HTTP requests to the AgentCore runtime endpoint with district and meal_type parameters
3. WHEN search responses are received THEN the LLM SHALL parse the restaurant data from the HTTP response and validate the structure
4. WHEN restaurant data is obtained THEN the LLM SHALL establish HTTP connection to the deployed AgentCore MCP server `restaurant_reasoning_mcp-UFz1VQCFu1`
5. WHEN calling the reasoning server THEN the LLM SHALL use HTTP requests to the AgentCore runtime endpoint with the restaurant list and ranking method parameters
6. WHEN reasoning responses are received THEN the LLM SHALL extract the recommendation and candidates from the HTTP response
7. WHEN HTTP connections fail THEN the LLM SHALL implement retry logic and error handling for AgentCore connectivity issues
8. WHEN AgentCore calls fail THEN the LLM SHALL handle execution errors gracefully and provide meaningful error context
9. IF AgentCore servers are unavailable THEN the LLM SHALL return appropriate error messages indicating which AgentCore service is unavailable
10. WHEN AgentCore responses are malformed THEN the LLM SHALL handle parsing errors and provide fallback responses

9. IF restaurant images or additional media are available THEN they SHALL be included in the restaurant objects with appropriate URLs
10. WHEN operating hours are included THEN they SHALL be formatted consistently for frontend display (e.g., "Mon-Fri: 07:00-11:30")

### Requirement 5 - Internal LLM Natural Language Processing
