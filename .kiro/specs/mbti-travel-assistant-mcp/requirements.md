# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating an MBTI Travel Assistant that operates as a Bedrock AgentCore runtime service that receives HTTP requests with MBTI personality parameters and generates comprehensive 3-day travel itineraries. The system uses Amazon Nova Pro foundation model to query an OpenSearch knowledge base for MBTI-matched tourist spots and integrates with existing MCP servers for restaurant recommendations.

The application follows the BedrockAgentCore runtime pattern with an entrypoint that receives MBTI personality types (4-character codes), processes them through Nova Pro to extract personality-matched tourist spots from the knowledge base, and creates detailed 3-day itineraries with morning/afternoon/night sessions plus breakfast/lunch/dinner restaurant assignments. The system integrates with existing MCP servers: `restaurant-search-mcp` and `restaurant-search-result-reasoning-mcp` for restaurant data and recommendations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1 - MBTI Personality Processing and Knowledge Base Integration

**User Story:** As a web server, I want to send HTTP requests with MBTI personality parameters to the MBTI Travel Assistant, so that I can receive comprehensive 3-day travel itineraries with personality-matched tourist spots and restaurant recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an HTTP request is received with JWT authentication THEN the system SHALL validate the JWT token and extract user context
2. WHEN a payload contains MBTI_personality parameter (4-character code) THEN the system SHALL validate the MBTI format and pass it to Nova Pro foundation model
3. WHEN Nova Pro processes the MBTI personality THEN it SHALL query the OpenSearch knowledge base using optimized prompts to extract personality-matched tourist spots
4. WHEN knowledge base queries are executed THEN the system SHALL use efficient search strategies similar to `test_single_mbti_type.py` but optimized for faster response times
5. WHEN tourist spots are retrieved THEN the system SHALL create a 3-day itinerary with morning/afternoon/night sessions following strict assignment logic
6. WHEN itinerary sessions are assigned THEN the system SHALL ensure no tourist spot is repeated across the entire 3-day period
7. WHEN the final response is generated THEN it SHALL include complete itinerary data, candidate tourist spots, and restaurant assignments in structured JSON format
8. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 with appropriate error messages
9. IF knowledge base queries fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide fallback itinerary options

### Requirement 2 - 3-Day Itinerary Generation with Session Assignment Logic

7. WHEN session assignment fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback assignment logic while maintaining the no-repeat constraint
8. WHEN all sessions are assigned THEN each tourist spot SHALL include all original fields plus a new "MBTI_match" boolean field
