# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan creates the MBTI Travel Assistant as a BedrockAgentCore runtime that generates comprehensive 3-day travel itineraries based on MBTI personality types. The system receives HTTP requests with 4-character MBTI personality codes, uses Amazon Nova Pro foundation model to query an OpenSearch knowledge base for personality-matched tourist spots, implements strict session assignment logic for morning/afternoon/night activities, and integrates with existing MCP servers for restaurant recommendations. The system returns complete JSON responses with main itinerary, candidate lists, and comprehensive metadata.

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components with comprehensive mocking
- Integration tests with actual knowledge base and MCP server connections
- Performance tests for 10-second response time requirements
- End-to-end tests for complete 3-day itinerary validation

### Deployment Considerations
- ARM64 container architecture required for AgentCore
- Environment-specific configuration for knowledge base and MCP endpoints
- Cognito User Pool integration for JWT authentication
- CloudWatch integration for monitoring and observability

### Business Logic Priorities
- Strict session assignment logic with operating hours validation
- District and area matching for afternoon and night sessions
- Tourist spot and restaurant uniqueness across entire 3-day period
- MBTI personality alignment with comprehensive fallback strategies
